# Preparing the information

## Loading the libraries

```{r include=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```



```{r load the slaughtered data set, include=FALSE}
animals_slaughtered_for_meat <- read_csv("archive (5)/animals-slaughtered-for-meat.csv")
```

```{r changing names, include=FALSE}
#Change the name of some columns to create subsets
colnames(animals_slaughtered_for_meat)[colnames(animals_slaughtered_for_meat) == "Turkey (turkeys slaughtered)"] <- "Turkey"
colnames(animals_slaughtered_for_meat)[colnames(animals_slaughtered_for_meat) == "Pigs (pigs slaughtered)"] <- "Pigs"
colnames(animals_slaughtered_for_meat)[colnames(animals_slaughtered_for_meat) == "Cattle (cattle slaughtered)"] <- "Cattle"
colnames(animals_slaughtered_for_meat)[colnames(animals_slaughtered_for_meat) == "Goats (goats slaughtered)"] <- "Goats"
colnames(animals_slaughtered_for_meat)[colnames(animals_slaughtered_for_meat) == "Chicken (chicken slaughtered)"] <- "Chicken"
colnames(animals_slaughtered_for_meat)[colnames(animals_slaughtered_for_meat) == "Sheep (sheeps slaughtered)"] <- "Sheep"
```

## A glance to the data
Head of data animals slaughtered

```{r head of data animals slaughtered DS}
#head of data set
head(animals_slaughtered_for_meat)
```

Summary of data animals slaughtered 

```{r summary of data animals slaughtered DS}
#Summary of data set
summary(animals_slaughtered_for_meat)
```

### Analysing the NA values

```{r observing NA values}
#Observing data with NA values
animals_slaughtered_for_meat[rowSums(is.na(animals_slaughtered_for_meat)) > 0, ]
```

Observing the NA values with NA values in the code column

```{r observing data with NA values in the code column}
#Observing data with NA values in the code column
animals_slaughtered_for_meat[is.na(animals_slaughtered_for_meat$Code), ]
```

Cleaning the rows without code.
```{r Cleaning codes for continents}
#Because the code does not have codes for the continents, it is necessary to erase those rows.
#Delete columns without code (Only rows that are continents)
animals_slaughtered_for_meat[!is.na(animals_slaughtered_for_meat$Code), ]
```
